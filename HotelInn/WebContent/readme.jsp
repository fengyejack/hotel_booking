<h4 style="font-family: times; color: blue;">2. Reflection</h4>
<b style="color: red;">2.1 What WE have learned</b><br><br>
2.1.1 How to use JDBC to connect to the database and execute query.<br>
2.1.2 How to use MVC pattern to design and control the web application.<br>
2.1.3 More proficient with web application programming with Servlet and JSP.<br>
<br>
<b style="color: red;">2.2 What WE need to improve</b><br><br>
2.2.1 How to build the database structure efficiently.<br>
------DateBase design such as more TABLES with less ATTRIBUTES and less TABLES with more ATTRIBUTE have both pros and cons. 
Therefore, building an efficient database structure should be the fundamental basis for any web applications.
<br><br>
2.2.2 How to improve the performance of the MVC pattern.<br>
------MVC pattern should be the key aspect for the web application performance, but how to optimize it??<br><br>
2.2.3 Servlet and JSP design in terms of various web application function.<br>
------The basic Servlet and JSP design should also be considered throughly.
Like when and where to validate the user input to grant the security of web application.<br>
<br>
<h4 style="font-family: times; color: blue;">3. Remark</h4>
<b> It is extremely painful in the beginning to build the web application from scratch, but life becomes more easier when the main
MVC pattern is figured out and basic database is built up, even though they are not very perfect. With the web application function been
implemented, the MVC and database are updated accordingly. In spite of the big workload of updating, the MVC pattern still make it easy to control.</b><br><br>
<b>I presume the most significant part of web application design is the MVC pattern design and the most huge workload is the optimization.  </b>
